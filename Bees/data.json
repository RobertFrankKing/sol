  "description": "Bees is a cognitive general-purpose large model developed by combining swarms. This model relies on Bees' years of accumulated strengths in computing power, big data, and engineering, integrating the technical capabilities of the BeesGPT large model, BeesCV large model, and Bees multimodal large model. The Bees large model has ten core capabilities, including content generation, multi-turn dialogue, and logical reasoning, as well as hundreds of specific functions, which can reshape the new paradigm of human-computer collaboration.
